1. Create layout for the webpage
2. Create a grid container for the sketch area
3. Add colour picker
4. Add slider to control amount of pixels in the grid

For the grid, create a 'for loop' to loop the number of grids the user has input.
(E.g. If user input is 16x16, use for loop to loop 256 times to create 256 grids)

For the sliderInput, create a display row * column for each range. (E.g. 2 x 2, 4 x 4)
Then, connect the slider Input values to the arguments for the grid rows and columns.

For the colouring of the grids
1. make 3 modes (colour, rainbow and eraser)
2. Each mode will change when corresponding button is pressed.
